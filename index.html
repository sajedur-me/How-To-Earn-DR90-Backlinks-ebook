                <h2>Secrets of DR90+ backlinks!</h2>
                <p>
                    When talking about DR90+ backlinks, we call them the world's best.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Domain Rating (DR) is a metric Ahrefs uses to determine a website’s link profile quality. A site with a DR of 90 and above indicates that many authoritative websites link to it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The fact that the site has a DR means that people and search engines trust the site. Therefore, by getting a link from these sites, you transfer some of their authority to your website and enjoy its benefits to your business. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, let's say your tech site receives an editorial link from TechCrunch (DR 92, Traffic 14M), PCMag (DR 91, Traffic 19.8M), or other authoritative websites. Not only will your site be able to generate more organic traffic over time from this link, but you’ll also enjoy other benefits that’ll help improve your website’s online visibility!

                <h2>Editorial link: What's that?</h2>
                <p>
                    First, we must define an editorial link and what differentiates it from other backlink types.
                </p>
                <p>
                    According to Ahrefs, editorial links are organic backlinks. They're not traded, asked, or paid for, so you’re not violating Google’s spam policies by acquiring these links. The fact that editorial links are earned automatically makes them the safest and most valuable backlinks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, getting editorial links isn’t easy. You must create good, informative, and valuable content to get this link type for your website. Below are four types of content you must publish on your site for it to attract editorial links:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Infographics: These are visual representations of data that can communicate complex information in an easy-to-understand manner. They can be static or animated and used to illustrate various topics, from scientific research to marketing campaigns.

            <div class="page--content">
                <p>
                    Online tools: They can perform various tasks, from simple calculations to complex analyses. These tools provide immediate value to students, researchers, and anyone looking to quickly and easily access accurate information.                
                </p>
                <p>
                    Studies and research: These can provide unique insights on topics in different industries. They can help identify trends, develop new theories, test and confirm hypotheses, and inform policy decisions.                
                </p>
                <p>
                    Definitive guides and tutorials: They can provide beginners with step-by-step instructions on completing a task or achieving a goal.

                    After weeks of hard work and research into creating our link-worthy content, it’s time to find out who was there to publish it. We were confident in positive results as our writing was unique and filled a knowledge gap in the industry. But finding journalists, reporters, or publishers interested in giving links to our content was another tough task.

                <p>
                    Once we knew the relevant journalists, we crafted a clear pitch explaining the study, our findings, and why it was appropriate for their audience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We personalized the pitch for each journalist, highlighting their previous work in this area and explaining why we thought our story would interest them.
